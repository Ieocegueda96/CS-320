Software Test Automation &amp; QA

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Testing software is important to ensuring coding functionality and security. Visually inspecting my code is important to find and filter out any initial errors. Software testing is another important way of both finding bugs/errors and ensuring system functionality. Using automated testing software, such as JUnit, can help make testing more efficient.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Interpreting user needs can be a bit challenging, but a good way to do it is by having the developer and project lead get together with the user with a list of questions to ensure that they have a good initial understanding of the project needs. Another way is to create incremental versions of the program, show these to the user, and incorporate feedback to the next iteration.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I personally prefer the Agile method of software design. I like the flexibility and adaptability that it offers. Having open communication with the user is also important as it ensures that the end product is very close or better than the user expected. Agile also allows quick adjustments to the software in case the user expresses a new need or is not satisfied with my initial design. Agile also allows testing to be done throughout the development process, and with the new continous testing methodologies taught in the course, can even automate the process to make agile much more efficient.
